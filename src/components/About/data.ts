    I’m passionate about my craft and I want to be confident enough in any technology
     that I’m working with that I can teach anyone about what I do. 
     I dive deep to be a reliable source of knowledge for my team. 
     At the same time, I’m a huge believer in strictly defining results, 
     and learning what you need to deliver those results. 
     It’s a balancing act of refining the art of code and satisfying the needs of 
     the client. 
     I take pride in taking on any role my team needs while inspiring positivity and maintaining momentum in our collaborative space. I’m a resourceful and enthusiastic learner and I’m excited to build things that matter.`,
